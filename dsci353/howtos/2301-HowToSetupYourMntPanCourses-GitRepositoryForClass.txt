We keep all our course files and git repositories for DSCI/EMSE courses

  In /mnt/pan/courses/COURSENAME
  
  So for DSCI353/453
  
    This is in /mnt/pan/courses/dsci353-453
    BUt use the correct Course for what you are enrolled in. 
  
  
  1. So in your Course folder under /mnt/pan/courses
  
  2. You want to go there 
  
    cd /mnt/pan/courses/dsci353-453
    
  3. And make a directory under dsci353/453 that is your CaseID
  
    mkdir rxf131
    
  4. now change into your own CaseID folder
  
    cd rxf131
    
  5. Now make your folder private to your self
    While you are in the "root" or top level directory of your /mnt/pan/courses/COURSE/CaseID/
    
      chmod 700 .

    Note the "." tells chmod to change the current directory.
    giving it 700 permissions, which means its R/W for you, and invisible to other people
    
  6. Now make your Git folder
  
    mkdir Git
    
  7. Change into your Git subdirectory
  
    cd Git
    
  8. Now Clone your personal course Git Repository.
    Using the https protocol
  
      git clone https://vuvlab@bitbucket.org/cwrudsci/23s-dsci353-453-zeb2.git

    
  Now your all setup
