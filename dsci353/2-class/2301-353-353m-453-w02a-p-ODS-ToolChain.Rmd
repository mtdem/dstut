##### Syllabus

![DSCI351-351M-451 Syllabus](./figs/syllabus.png)

#### Current Status of Everyone in Class

- So as of today, All the elements for the course should be working for you

If not, reach out to the TAs ( @kristen hernandez and @will oltjen )

  -  Defining where you issue is
  - And we'll fix it
  
You should all have the following Elements setup

  -  You have Forked the `23s-dsci353-453-prof` Bitbucket Repo
    - And changed the `prof` to your caseID
    - You can sync new changes in prof repo to your personal repo.
  - And you have 
    - Logged into http://ondemand.case.edu
    - And launched a "RStudio Server (rxf131)"
    - And made a Git folder in your /mnt/pan/courses/dsci353-453/caseID folder
    - And do the config commands for your name and email of your Git Server
    - And made the /mnt/pan/courses/dsci353-453/caseID folder
  - You have joined the DSCI Slack
    - using your caseID email address
    - And joined the DSCI353-353m-453 Slack Channel
    - And for DSCI453 students, have joined the DSCI453 SemProj Channel
  
Lets check your "primary group" in HPC-Markov

  - Launch the SDLE Diagnostics App
  
Confirm your /mnt/pan/courses/caseID folder

  - Is only accessible to yourself
  - If others can enter your /mnt/pan/courses/dsci353-453/caseID folder
    - Then in an LXDE desktop
    - Open the file manager
    - navigate to /mnt/pan/courses/dsci353-453/caseID folder
    - right click on your folder
    - go to permissions tab
    - and change all 3 access choices to be `only owner`
  
##### Prof. Laura Bruckman will present in class Today

- To give more information on the Semester Projects for DSCI453 students

  -  This includes 3 Reports Outs by 453 Students
    - That **all students will view and do peer grading of**


#### The Lab Exercises (LEs)

- Each LE is worth 9 points (except LE0 = 0 points)

So 63 points are in the Lab Exercises

  - So these are important and critical to learning
  - You will need to start on the early
    - This is why you are given two weeks to do them
  - You turn in both the .Rmd and the .pdf file
    - We grade on the .pdf file in Canvas
  - We expect good code styling
    - That matches the Google/Rstudio R Style Guide
    - Since this aides collaboration
  
The Deep learning, TensorFlow, GPU problems

  - Are after the midterm break
  - And these problems can be quite challenging
  - So start on the LEs early
    - And ask questions in the DSCI Slack Channel

LE1 is posted today. 

#### Literate Programing: Donald Knuth

- [Donald Knuth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Knuth)

  - Bachelors and Masters degrees from CWRU
  - PhD from CalTech
  - CS Professor at Stanford
  
Did a great many things in Computer Science

  - [TAOCP: The Art of Computer Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Art_of_Computer_Programming)
    - Started in 1962, and not yet finished
    - Currently 7 volumes
  - [He also develeded TeX, the precursor to LaTeX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TeX)
  
##### [Literature Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming), was another of his goals

- Literate programming is a programming paradigm introduced by Donald Knuth 

  - in which a program is given as an explanation of the program logic 
    - in a natural language, such as English, 
  - interspersed with snippets of macros and traditional source code, 
    - from which a compilable source code can be generated.

The literate programming paradigm, as conceived by Knuth, 

  - represents a move away from writing programs 
    - in the manner and order imposed by the computer, 
    - and instead enables programmers to develop programs in the order 
    - demanded by the logic and flow of their thoughts. 
  - Literate programs are written as an uninterrupted exposition of logic 
    - in an ordinary human language, much like the text of an essay, 
    - in which macros are included to hide abstractions and traditional source code.
  - Literate programming (LP) tools are used 
    - to obtain two representations from a literate source file: 
    - one suitable for further compilation or execution by a computer, the "tangled" code, 
    - and another for viewing as formatted documentation, which is said to be "woven" from the literate source. 
  - While the first generation of literate programming tools 
    - were computer language-specific, 
    - the later ones are language-agnostic 
    - and exist above the programming languages.

Now a days one can integrate R and Python code in a common shared environment, 

  - as can be done with Rstudio v1.2 and the reticulate package.
  - We use this in our data analytics in the SDLE Research Center at CWRU. 

#### Agile Software Development

- In early 2000's the way software is developed changed Radically

  - With the [Agile Manifesto](http://agilemanifesto.org/)
  - And the [Agile Software Development Principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development#Agile_software_development_principles)
  - [Overview of Agile Software Development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development#Overview)
  - [Agile Development Philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development#Philosophy)
  
Agile is enabled by Literate Programming

  - And Relies on an Open Tool Chain

#### Your Open Data Science Tool Chain

##### Its all about a Data Science Tool Chain

  * Use R and build on the communities foundation
  * Use Rstudio as a comfy environment
  * Share your Open Data and Open Source Code
  * Produce Reproducible Science with Rmarkdown  
    + Use [Creative Commons Licenses](https://creativecommons.org/)
    + Or other [Open Source Licenses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_free_and_open-source_software_licenses)
    + Such as the [Gnu Public License: GPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License)


###### Pilot your DSCI studies using available data

  * Find available data sets
  * Before starting the costly process of making data

###### Use Git repositories

  * For version control
  * For Collaboration
  * For Open Science sharing


##### Twitter used for Data Science

- As part of setting up our Data Science Tool Chain

  * Sign up for a Twitter account 
  * [Using Twitter in university research](http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/files/2011/11/Published-Twitter_Guide_Sept_2011.pdf)

##### Sign up for a Stack Exchange Account

- Stack Exchange, Stack Overflow

  * are a Q&A community focused on many topics.  

Stack Overflow allows you to search by tag

  * r and rmarkdown are useful tags for SO

###### [Stack Exchange's Tour of Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/tour)  

###### Specific Stack Exchange websites

  * for [SX Data Science](https://datascience.stackexchange.com/)                             
  * for [SX Statistics on Cross Validated](http://stats.stackexchange.com/) 
  * for [SX Open Data](http://opendata.stackexchange.com/)             

##### Efficiently browse you SX sites

  * Google (but more random)
  * [The Stack Exchange apps](http://stackapps.com/) 
  * Using an [RSS Feed reader such as Feedly](http://feedly.com/i/latest) is a good way

##### Online Git Server Communities

  * After your [BitBucket Account](http://bitbucket.org) 
  * You'll probably want a [GitHub](http://github.com/) account,.
  * Many R Projects are there, and 
  * you can fork their repo's to inspect the code very easily.

##### Slack, another component of [Agile Sofware Development]

  - [cwru-dsci.slack.com](https://cwru-dsci.slack.com/)
    - an online collaboration tool
  - Its an intrinsic part of agile software development
    - There is slack app for phones
    - And client for computers, its on VDI.


#### You Online Data Science Portfolio

  - Doing open, reproducible data science
  - Lets you share a portfolio of codes and projects
  - Cite it in your resume
  - Build a community of supporters and collaborators
  - Need to be conscious of data use terms and agreements
    - Funded research at CWRU falls under IP agreements
    - So when you consider licenses you want to use
    - They must be consistent with the IP terms that came
    - With datasets and codes
  
##### An Example, Emeline Liu

  - [emelineliu.com](http://emelineliu.com/)
    -  This website, which runs off of [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), is my latest project. 
    - Right now, I'm using [Poole](http://getpoole.com/) as a foundation for my website/blog.
