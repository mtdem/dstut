##### Tidyverse Cheatsheets, Functions and Reading Your Code

- Look at the Tidyverse Cheatsheet 

  - **Tidyverse For Beginners Cheatsheet**
    - In the Git/20s-dsci353-353m-453-prof/3-readings/3-CheatSheets/ folder
  - **Data Wrangling with dplyr and tidyr Cheatsheet**

  
  Tidyverse Functions & Conventions
  
    - The pipe operator `%>%`
    - Use `dplyr::filter()` to subset data row-wise.
    - Use `dplyr::arrange()`  to sort the observations in a data frame
    - Use `dplyr::mutate()` to update or create new columns of a data frame
    - Use `dplyr::summarize()` to turn many observations into a single data point
    - Use `dplyr::arrange()` to change the ordering of the rows of a data frame 
    - Use `dplyr::select()` to choose variables from a tibble, 
      - keeps only variables you mention
    - Use `dplyr::rename()` keeps all the variables and renames variables
      - rename(iris, petal_length = Petal.Length)
    - These can be combined using `dplyr::group_by()` 
      - which lets you perform operations “by group”. 
    - The `%in%` matches conditions provided by a vector using the c() function
    - The **forcats** package has tidyverse functions 
      - for factors (categorical variables)
    - The **readr** package has tidyverse functions 
      - to read_..., melt_... col_..., parse_... data and objects

Reading Your Code: Whenever you see

  - The assignment operator `<-`, think **"gets"**
  - The pipe operator, `%>%`, think **"then"**

#### Syllabus

![Modeling, Prediction and Machine Learning Syllabus](./figs/syllabus.png) 

#### Open Data Science (ODS) & HPC Compute Engines

- You can do data analysis on your notebook computer

  - You can setup your own notebook
    - For data science using R or Python
    - Full instructions are in the class syllabus, section 11
    - For Linux, Mac's or Windows Operating Systems
    - But Many times you'll need more compute power than your notebook
    - Such as GPUs (Graphics Processing Units) to accelerate computations
    
But its useful to learn about a variety of Compute Resources

  - In Class we'll use 
    - Markov Data Science Cluster
      - A high performance computing cluster
    - or Open Data Science Desktops
  
These are all configured the same

  - Independent of the Operating System
  - They have R with Rstudio IDE (Integrated Development Environment)
  - Git for code versioning
  - LaTeX for publication quality report generation
  - And also Python3 with PyCharm IDE
  
##### The two cloud computing systems: Markov HPC Cluster & ODS Win10 Desktop

  - Markov Data Science HPC Cluster
    - Log in to http://ondemand.case.edu 
    - Using your CaseID and password
    - Launch the SDLE Rstudio Server-4.1.1
    - You can also get a KDE Desktop on Markov

##### CWRU HPC provides Markov

  - [CWRU's HPC (High Peformance Computing) Markov Cluster](https://sites.google.com/a/case.edu/hpcc/)
    - This runs RedHat Linux version 7
    - Has 4400 CPU cores
    - Has 100,000 GPU cores
    - Up to a terabyte of Ram
  - And has a new Data Science Cluster, named [Markov.case.edu](https://markov.case.edu)
    - With a Hadoop Cluster for distributed computing
    - And dedicated GPUs
  - You'll get accounts on CWRU HPC
  - And use [http://ondemand.case.edu](http://ondemand.case.edu)
    - To login to Markov and get a KDE Desktop session
  
![Markov Cluster](./figs/markov.png)
  
##### You also have access to the ODS Win10 Desktops

  - These are cloud Windows computers
    - That you log into from a Browser 
    - login to http://myapps.case.edu
    - With your CaseID and password
  - The ODS VDIs are Windows 10 computers
  - The ODS VDIs don't have GPUs
    
Not for class, but for your own data science projects.

##### And you can also use [Google's Kaggle.com](http://www.kaggle.com) 
  
  - Here one can run R or Python
  - Using [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) Interface
  - Has Free GPUs
  
And you can use Google's Collaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/welcome.ipynb)

  - For Jupyter Notebooks
  - Running Python3
  - Doesn't support R language yet
  - Free GPUs and [TPUs (Tensor Processing Unit)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor_processing_unit)
  


#### Operating Systems: Windows, OSX and Linux

- Command Line Environments

  - Linux: Bash on Linux, or Git Bash on Windows
  - Mac OSX: Bash in Terminal
  - Windows: Command.com Terminal
  - In R: R Console, or Console in RStudio
  


    Item               Linux       OSX Mac       Windows 
-----------------  ------------  ------------  ------------ 
folder demarcation     /              /        "\\" don't use
directory listing     ls             ls            dir     
present work. dir     pwd           pwd           
change directory      cd            cd               cd
drives               root          root         drive letters
NO SPACES in        filenames     spaces         don't work


##### Basic/Universal Rules

  - No Spaces in Filenames
  - Only 1 period in a filename, before file extension
  - No other periods
  - Only Letters, Underscore (_), and Dashes (-) in Filenames
  - In code scripts, use forward slash in all file paths and directories
  - You can use CamelBack or snake_case in variable or file names
    - To make code easier to read.
  - Code Style is Rstudio or Google R style
  - No use of = for Assignments
  - Only use <- as the Assignment Operator in R
    - Rstudio Cheat Sheet says <- is "Alt -" in R code

#### Quick Introduction to R/Rstudio/Git

- R is the statistical programming language

Rstudio is the Integrated Development Environment (IDE)

Git is the distributed content versioning system

#### What we need to do this week

- 1. Setup our Markov and Open Data Science (ODS) Computers

    - For Markov Data Science Cluster
      - login to http://ondemand.case.edu
      - Launch the SDLE Rstudio Server-4.1.1
