##### Tidyverse Cheatsheets, Functions and Reading Your Code

- Look at the Tidyverse Cheatsheet 

  - **Tidyverse For Beginners Cheatsheet**
    - In the Git/20s-dsci353-353m-453-prof/3-readings/3-CheatSheets/ folder
  - **Data Wrangling with dplyr and tidyr Cheatsheet**

  
  Tidyverse Functions & Conventions
  
    - The pipe operator `%>%`
    - Use `dplyr::filter()` to subset data row-wise.
    - Use `dplyr::arrange()`  to sort the observations in a data frame
    - Use `dplyr::mutate()` to update or create new columns of a data frame
    - Use `dplyr::summarize()` to turn many observations into a single data point
    - Use `dplyr::arrange()` to change the ordering of the rows of a data frame 
    - Use `dplyr::select()` to choose variables from a tibble, 
      - keeps only variables you mention
    - Use `dplyr::rename()` keeps all the variables and renames variables
      - rename(iris, petal_length = Petal.Length)
    - These can be combined using `dplyr::group_by()` 
      - which lets you perform operations “by group”. 
    - The `%in%` matches conditions provided by a vector using the c() function
    - The **forcats** package has tidyverse functions 
      - for factors (categorical variables)
    - The **readr** package has tidyverse functions 
      - to read_..., melt_... col_..., parse_... data and objects

Reading Your Code: Whenever you see

  - The assignment operator `<-`, think **"gets"**
  - The pipe operator, `%>%`, think **"then"**

#### Care and feeding of your files and your repository

**Before next week's Thursday in-class MidTerm Exam**

  - Check `git status` of you class repository on Markov/OnDemand or computer
  - Make sure you can `git pull` 
  - And that you can `git push`
  - And `git add --all :/` to stage your local changed files to the commit list
  - Then `git commit -m 'updating my repo'`
  - Then `git push`
  
Its essential to have an up-to-date copy of your repo in bitbucket

If you want to make backup copies of any files

  - For safety for example
    - Copy them to a new folder in your `/home/caseID` directory
    - Copy them to your google drive
    - Copy them to your local computer
  
Also you can do the midterm on either

  - Markov Data Science Cluster
    - Using an Rstudio Server (rxf131) {The 22.04 version}
    - via (http://ondemand.case.edu)
  - Or on ODS Win10 Desktops
    - Using an Rstudio on the ODS Desktop
    - via (http://myapps.case.edu)
    
So go and login to both of these

  - And setup your Git server
    - Check your Git Server Configuration
      - `git config --list`
    - Its essential to initially configure your git server
      - `git config --global user.name "[name]"`
      - `git config --global user.email "[email address]"`
  - And clone your personal class repository 
    - to both Markov and ODS Desktop
    - `git clone https://vuvlab@bitbucket.org/vuvlab/22s-dsci353-353m-453-e1453-e2453-CaseID.git`
    - But with your CaseID in the command


#### DSCI353-353m-453 MidTerm exam overview

You can use the resources in your repo,

And the resources in R and Rstudio 

  - such as the help system

Turn in your .Rmd file and the compiled pdf 

  - to the canvas midterm exam assignment page

#### You'll want to review 

  - the class notes, 
  - and more particularly 
    - the .Rmd/pdf class notes on concepts and ideas.
  - and the readings in textbooks
    - R3DS
    - ISLR2
    - DLwR2
  - And the Deep Learning articles

You'll also want to be familiar with 

  - ISLR Chapters 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 
  - R4DS Chapters 1-25

And ISLR chapters 8, 9, 10, 12 aren't covered on the midterm exam

  - ISLR 8, Tree-based Methods
    - Decision Trees and Random Forest Machine Learning
  - ISLR 9, Support Vector Machines (SVM)
  - ISLR 10, Deep Learning
  - ISLR 12, Unsupervised Learning

And if you want you can review
 
  - Regression and Classification
  - in Open Intro Stats v4
    - OIS Chapters 8 and 9
    - On linear regression and multiple regression

#### The Practicum problems on the midterm 

  - are using the `Boston` dataset 
    - which is part of the `MASS` package. 
    
It records the median value of houses 

  - for 506 neighborhoods around Boston. 

This dataset is also used in ISLR Chapter 3, 

  - section 3.6 Lab Linear and Multiple Regression.  
  - Sections 3.6.1 to 3.6.7, Pages 109 - 119. 

#### Use good code style

  - **Comment your code**
  - Use `ggplot2` for plots
  - **Make plots with proper axis labels and titles**
  - Not just variable names for axis labels
  - **Use tidyverse commands, and pipes in your code**

#### You have 1 hour and 15 minutes

  * The midterm is worth 10 points.  
  * Points for each question are as follows
    - 1. 3 pts
    - 2. 3 pts
    - 3. 4 pts
    
#### Good code style will count in the grading

  - Good code style
    - Commenting your code to make it clear
    - `<-` assignment operator
    - spaces around operators
    - spaces after commas
    - indentation of multiline commands
    - indentation of loops and functions
  - Using `ggplot2`
  - Using `tidyverse` packages and `dplyr` pipes
    - as appropriate

#### Problems on the MidTerm

##### Problem 1: Foundation Questions (3 pts)

##### Problem 2: Practicum- Linear Regression (3 pts)

##### Problem 3: Practicum- Multiple Regression (4 pts)
