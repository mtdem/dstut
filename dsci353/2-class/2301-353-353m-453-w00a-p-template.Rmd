##### Tidyverse Cheatsheets, Functions and Reading Your Code

- Look at the Tidyverse Cheatsheet 

  - **Tidyverse For Beginners Cheatsheet**
    - In the Git/20s-dsci353-353m-453-prof/3-readings/3-CheatSheets/ folder
  - **Data Wrangling with dplyr and tidyr Cheatsheet**

  
  Tidyverse Functions & Conventions
  
    - The pipe operator `%>%`
    - Use `dplyr::filter()` to subset data row-wise.
    - Use `dplyr::arrange()`  to sort the observations in a data frame
    - Use `dplyr::mutate()` to update or create new columns of a data frame
    - Use `dplyr::summarize()` to turn many observations into a single data point
    - Use `dplyr::arrange()` to change the ordering of the rows of a data frame 
    - Use `dplyr::select()` to choose variables from a tibble, 
      - keeps only variables you mention
    - Use `dplyr::rename()` keeps all the variables and renames variables
      - rename(iris, petal_length = Petal.Length)
    - These can be combined using `dplyr::group_by()` 
      - which lets you perform operations “by group”. 
    - The `%in%` matches conditions provided by a vector using the c() function
    - The **forcats** package has tidyverse functions 
      - for factors (categorical variables)
    - The **readr** package has tidyverse functions 
      - to read_..., melt_... col_..., parse_... data and objects

Reading Your Code: Whenever you see

  - The assignment operator `<-`, think **"gets"**
  - The pipe operator, `%>%`, think **"then"**
