\section{Joint Undergraduate and Graduate Course}

  \subsection{DSCI353 and DSCI353M}

    DSCI353 is the 4th level class in the \textbf{Applied Data Science Undergraduate Minor}.
    The ADS Minor is available to CWRU students across all the schools of the University.
    For more information see

    \begin{itemize}
      \item Applied Data Science in the CWRU Bulletin
        \subitem \href{https://bulletin.case.edu/schoolofengineering/materialsscienceengineering/#undergraduatetext}{https://bulletin.case.edu/schoolofengineering/materialsscienceengineering/\#undergraduatetext},
       \item And the CWRU Data Science Web Page

    \end{itemize}

    DSCI353 will introduce students to linear and beyond linear modeling, prediction and machine learning (including Kera/TensorFlow and Torch deep learning frameworks), the steps in a data analysis the following data cleaning, exploratory data analysis and introduction to linear modeling (the subject of DSCI351-451).
    This course will use an open data science tool chain consisting of R coding, Rmarkdown, Rstudio IDE and Git version control, and will be based in inferential statistical concepts, the stages of a data analysis and reproducible research.

    DSCI353M section focuses specifically on Exploratory Data Science of Materials and Materials Systems.

  \subsection{DSCI453}

    DSCI453 is a graduate level introduction to data science modeling and prediction.
    Graduate students will, in addition to the coursework of DSCI353, develop a semester long data science project focused on a topic relevant to their graduate research area, for example time-series, spectral, or image data science problems.

    These projects will include preparing datasets, code scripts and functions, a git repository for other students to use these codes as open source resources, and the preparation of reproducible data science analyses for these problems.

    DSCI453 is one of the classes that satisfy the requirements for the CWRU \textbf{University Graduate Certificate in Applied Data Science}.
    More information on this transcriptable certificate is available.

    \end{enumerate}

\section{Course Description}

  In this course, we will use an open data science tool chain to develop reproducible data analyses useful for inference and prediction, using modeling and machine learning, for the behavior of complex systems.
  In addition to the standard data cleaning, assembly and exploratory data analysis steps essential to all data analyses, we will identify statistically significant relationships from datasets derived from population samples, and infer the reliability of these findings.
  We will use regression methods to model a number of both real-world and lab-based systems producing predictive models applicable in comparable populations.
  We will assembly and explore real-world datasets, use pair-wise plots to explore correlations, perform clustering, self-similarity, and logistic regression develop both fixed-effect and mixed-effect predictive models.
  We will also introduce machine-learning approaches for regression and classification including Keras/TensorFlow for neural network and other modeling techniques.
  Results will be interpreted, visualized and discussed.

  We will introduce the basic elements of data science and analytics using \href{"http://cran.case.edu/"}{R Project open source software}.
  We will also use the Rstudio IDE (Integrated Development Environment), \url{https://www.rstudio.com/products/RStudio/}.
  R is an open-source software project with broad abilities to access machine-readable open-data resources, data cleaning and assembly functions, and a rich selection of statistical packages, used for data analytics, model development, prediction, inference and clustering.
  We will also learn tidy principles for data analysis, pipes and ggplot vs base graphics approaches to data visualization.

  For students with little prior R experience, we'll introduce resources to learn R data types, reading and writing data, looping, plotting and regular expressions.
  With this background, it becomes possible to start performing variable transformations for linear regression fitting and developing structural equation models, fixed-effects and mixed-effects models along with other statistical learning techniques, while exploring for statistically significant relationships.

  Python version 3 (or Python3) is also commonly used for data science and data analyses, while at the same time Python is a general purpose programming language.
  Both R and Python are interpreted languages that do not require compiling the code prior to execution.
  Due to Python's broader spread of use cases (from data analysis to full applications to software engineering) it can be easier for a developing data scientist to find useful answers to questions, by learning R first.
  Python can then be learned as a second data analysis language.
  Students are welcome to use Python in the DSCI classes.

  The class is taught using a ``practicum'' approach and will be structured to have a balance of theory and practice.
  We'll split class into Foundation and Practicum
  	a) Foundation: lectures, presentations, discussion
  	b) Practicum: coding, demonstrations and hands-on data science work.

  Every student will have access to their own pre-configured Open Data Science VDI computer, already configured for fast and easy adoption of good data science practices and tools.

  \subsection{Background Data Science books from DSCI351}

    Peng R Programming (PRP) (Figure 1) and Peng Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) (Figure 2) are introductory books to R and Data Science and Analysis.
    These are  Leanpub books, available from LeanPub for a ”pay what you want” price.

    OpenIntro Statistics (Figure 3), is the open source Inferential Statistics Textbook that we use in DSCI 351/351m/451.

    Also R for Data Science (Figure 4) teaches using R and the Tidyverse Functions for efficient and streamlined data analysis code.
    So this is a very important book to be familiar with.

  \subsection{DSCI353-353M-453 Textbooks}

    The main textbooks for this semester are the following

    \begin{enumerate}
      \item \textbf{Introduction to Statistical Learning with R, 2nd Edition 2021} (ISLR, Figure 5) is a Springer book which is available for free as a pdf.
      \item \textbf{R for Data Science} (R4DS, Figure 4), which teaches Tidyverse R coding, is used in both DSCI351/351m/451 and DSCI353/353m/453 courses.
      \item \textbf{Deep Learning with R} (DLwR, Figure 7) is used in DSCI353-353m-453 for Deep Learning and TensorFlow.
      \item \textbf{Deep Learning} by Goodfellow, Bengio, 2016 for training deep networks.
    \end{enumerate}

    We will also use a second deep learning framework, Torch from R, and PyTorch for use from Python.

    Additional reading assignments will be distributed via the course git repository in the readings subdirectory.

    Note that ISLR 2nd Ed. is the introductory book, for which Elements of Statistical Learning (ESL, Figure 6) is the advanced book.
    ESL is widely considered the bible of Machine Learning, and is also in your repo in the 3-readings/1-textbooks folder.

  \subsection{Data-science Semester Project Report}
    %For DSCI353-353M, the final data science research report should be written like a scientific paper and have the following types of sections.

    \begin{itemize}
    	\item{Title}
    	\item{Author}
    	\item{Author Affiliation}
    	\item{ License: ideally CC-BY-SA 4.0  (but a license choice is yours)}
    \end{itemize}

    \begin{itemize}
    	\item{Abstract}
    	\item{Introduction}Modeling
    	\item{Data Science Methods}
    	\item{Exploratory Data Analysis}
    	\item{Statistical Learning: Modeling \& Prediction(if appropriate)}
    	\item{Discussion}
    	\item{Conclusions}
    	\item{Acknowledgements}
    	\item{References, Citations}
    \end{itemize}


  \subsubsection{Abstract}
    Summary of the nature, finding and meaning of your data analysis project.

  \subsubsection{Introduction}
    Background and motivation of the Data Science question.

  \subsubsection{Data Science Methods}
    To be applied (such as image processing, time-series analysis, spectral analysis etc.

  \subsubsection{Exploratory Data Analysis}
    Results and steps in the data analysis.

  \subsubsection{Statistical Learning: Modeling \& Prediction}
    If you analysis can accomplish some modeling, include it here.

  \subsubsection{Discussion}
    Discussion of the answers to the data science questions framed in the introduction.

  \subsubsection{Conclusions}

  \subsubsection{Acknowledgments}

  \subsubsection{References}

  \subsubsection{How to make your report}

    The report is done as an Markdown document, which can be run/compiled to produce two versions of the report as a pdf.
    One shows your R code and figures, and the other doesn't show R code, just your figures.

    You'll then turn in a zip file (and leave a copy in your repo), with the dataset (if its not to huge, if it is large, can you make a smaller dataset), Rmd file that works, and the two pdf reports.
    Just choose to do a pdf report, instead of a set of presentation slides.

    The license choice of CC-BY-SA 4.0 is suggested so that others can use and build on your codes, in an open-source manner.
    With more restrictive licenses, others won't be able to use your code in the future.

  \subsection{CopyLeft}

    Creative Commons plays an important role in openness and open science, open data, open source efforts.

    This DSCI class \cite{french_dsci351-4511:_2015} is covered by a \href{"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/"}{Creative Commons}  \cite{commons_creative_2014} copyleft licenses.

    The license we'll use for class materials, code and presentations is covered by  the "Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International" license, which is commonly called the CC BY-SA 4.0 license. \cite{_creative_2015}

    More information on licensing open works, can be found on Wikipedia. \cite{commons_creative_2014-1}

    \href{"http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html"}{GNU} \cite{gnu_gnu.org_2014} is the developer of the \href{"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License"}{GPL License} \cite{gpl_gnu_2014}  that is used for many open source software projects, such as Linux.

    Typically the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_License}{Apache License of the Apache Software Foundation} or \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_Software_Foundation_License}{Python Software Foundation} license are good choices for a `''permissive'' license.

    But the Gnu General Public License \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License}{GPLv2 and GPLv3}  are ``stronger'' free and open source software licenses.

\section{Setting up your R data science computer}

To setup and install the software for an R Open Data Science workstation, here's how. \\

Note that the ``R standard packages are listed under the ``For Windows'' section in subsubsection\ref{subsubsec:rstandpack}.  \\

\subsection{For Windows}

In Windows we are allowed to use spaces in filenames, however, most other systems does not support that.
To avoid conflicts or troubles, we suggest using \href{https://sanaulla.info/2008/06/25/camelcase-notation-naming-convention-for-programming-languages/}{camelBack} naming convention or use "-" or "\_" to replace spaces.

\subsubsection{LaTeX}

\LaTeX~is a document preparation system that is widely used in the academia for producing scientific documents.
You will need to install two softwares,  Miktex and TeXstudio. \\
\begin{itemize}
  \item Download and run the Basic MiKTeX Installer.
  MiKTeX has the ability to install missing packages automatically, i.e., this installer is suitable for computers connected to the Internet.
  Before you run the installer, you can check the \href{https://miktex.org/kb/prerequisites-2-9}{prerequisites}.
  The installer is available on the \href{https://miktex.org/download}{download} page.
  You start it with a double-click on the downloaded file.
  \item Read the Copying Conditions carefully and click "I accept the MiKTeX copying conditions", the click "Next", as demonstrated below.

  \begin{figure}[!ht]
    \centering

\subsection{For Mac}

\subsubsection{Homebrew}

Homebrew is a package manager for Mac OS.
To install Homebrew, paste and run the following command in terminal:
\begin{lstlisting}
  /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/
  install/master/install)"
\end{lstlisting}
You can read more about Homebrew \href{https://brew.sh/}{here}.

\subsubsection{XQuartz}

To correctly set up your linux environment, you should also install XQuartz.
XQuartz is Apple Inc.'s version of the X server, a component of the X Window System for macOS.
You can \href{https://www.xquartz.org/}{download} and install the latest version of XQuartz.

\subsubsection{LaTeX}

To install LaTeX on Mac, you need to install MacTeX and TeXstudio.
\begin{itemize}
  \item The current distribution as of today (\today)is MacTeX-2017.
  This distribution requires Mac OS 10.10, Yosemite, or higher and runs on Intel processors.
  To download, click \href{http://www.tug.org/mactex/mactex-download.html}{MacTeX Download}.
  \item After downloading, double click on the MacTeX.pkg to install.
  Follow the straightforward instructions.
  Installation on a recent Macintosh takes four to six minutes.
  \item At the end of installation, the installer will report "Success." But sometimes, the installer puts up a dialog saying "Verifying..." and then the install hangs.
  In all cases known to us, rebooting the Macintosh fixes this problem.
  After the reboot, install again.
  \item Now you can start installing TeXstudio.
  You can find the corresponding installer on the \href{https://www.texstudio.org/}{TeXstudio website}.
  \item Because the developers of TeXstudio do not have an Apple Developer Account, OS X may complain about an unidentified developer and deny opening TXS.
  In that case, open the context menu on the TXS icon (Ctrl + Click) and select open.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Git}

There are several ways to install Git on a Mac.
In fact, if you've installed XCode (or it's Command Line Tools), Git may already be installed.
To find out, open a terminal and enter git --version.

Apple actually maintain and ship their own fork of Git, but it tends to lag behind mainstream Git by several major versions.
You may want to install a newer version of Git using the method below:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Download the latest Git for \href{https://git-scm.com/download/mac}{Mac installer}.
  \item Follow the prompts to install Git.
  \item Open a terminal and verify the installation was successful by typing git --version.
  \item Configure your Git username and email using the following commands, replacing "yourusername" with your own.
  These details will be associated with any commits that you create:
  \begin{lstlisting}
    $ git config --global user.name "yourusername"
    $ git config --global user.email "youremail@website.com"
  \end{lstlisting}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{R}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Download R from \href{http://cran.us.r-project.org/}{CRAN} and click "Download R for (Mac) OS X".
  \item Follow the instructions and install R.
  \item Download the latest RStudio from their \href{https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/}{website}.
  Open the installer and follow the instructions.
\end{itemize}
