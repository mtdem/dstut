Hello @channel,

As you may have found out, our Bitbucket repo had some bugs resulting in the lost of functionality. 
Not to worry however, because loss of data is a common hurdle that all data-scientists must overcome! 
Unfortunately this means that everyone in the class will 
    Need to refork the -prof repo 
    and then re-clone it onto your Markov Desktop, ODS Desktop and your personal notebook computer.

Reforking the -prof repo
    1. Navigate to the21f-dsci351-351m-451-e1451-e2451-prof repo
       It is located at this link:https://bitbucket.org/cwrudsci/21f-dsci351-351m-451-e1451-e2451-prof/src/main/
 
    2. On the left side of the screen in the blue toolbar click on the "+" symbol
    3. Under the "Get to Work" subheading click "Fork This Repository"
    4. Name the new repository "21f-dsci351-351m-451-e1451-e2451-CASEID-v2"

This is so you have two distinct repos on your bitbucket
    The original personal class repo with  ...CASEID and the new personal class repo with name ....CASEID-v2

    5. Clone your new personal repo (CASEID-v2) by clicking on the "clone" gray button at the top of the screen
       Using https as your security protocol
       Into your Git directory

    6. Cloning the new repo onto your desktop
       Once you have copied your git clone link, return to Git Bash  (ODS Desktop) or Terminal (Markov)
    7. Navigate to your personal Git folder using the "cd" command
    8. Paste the clone command once you have navigated to the proper directory
       ODS Desktop should be something like "H:\Git/"
       Markov Desktop should be something like "~/home/CASEID/Git/"
       And on your personal computer, something like "/Documents/Git"

Once CASEID-v2 is successfully cloned down to your desktop 
    9. You can move (in file explorer) any files you have edited from your "...CaseID Repo folder 
       To your new "....CaseID-v2" repository folder.

This step makes sure you don't lose any of the work you've been doing on your LEs 
    (You should have started by now!!)
