#### Syllabus

![DSCI351-351M-451 Syllabus](./figs/syllabus.png)


#### For the DSCI 451 students they have an EDA SemProj to do

  - SemProjects:
    - SemProjects have a bi-weekly progress update 
      - due Friday's at 11:59 pm (6 updates)
    - Each update should be made in the report template 
      - found in the Repo with each update filled out
    - SemProj Report Out #1 Class W5, (recorded 10 min presentation)
      - Peer Grading by All DSCI 351/351m/451 students due a week later
    - SemProj Report Out #2 in Class W9 (recorded 10 min presentation)
      - Peer Grading by All DSCI 351/351m/451 students due a week later
    - SemProj Report Out #3 in Class W13 (recorded 10 min presentation)
      - Peer Grading by All DSCI 351/351m/451 students due a week later
    - SemProj Report is full comprehensive written project 
      - (report template updated from each report)
      - **due Friday 12-11-2021**
  - Assistance on SemProjects is done with DSCI352-352m-452 Class
    - SemProj's are taught by Prof. Laura Bruckman
    - SemProject office hours 9-10 am on Tuesdays

##### Care should be taken when choosing SemProj datasets.

  - Report Out 1 focuses on
    - Explaining the 'why' of your research project
    - Describing your dataset
    - Presenting an analysis plan
    - Cleaning your data
  - Report Out 2 focuses on:
    - EDA of your data
    - Visualizing your data
    - Further cleaning of your data
    - Reevaluation of your data analysis plan (Do you need more data?)
  - Report Out 3:
    - More data visualization
    - Initial modeling
    - Conclusions about your data
    - Were you able to answer your why question? 
    - What else would you need to do to get to understanding your data better?

#### Tidyverse Cheatsheets, Functions and Reading Your Code

- Look at the Tidyverse Cheatsheet 

  - **Tidyverse For Beginners Cheatsheet**
    - In the Git/20s-dsci353-353m-453-prof/3-readings/3-CheatSheets/ folder
  - **Data Wrangling with dplyr and tidyr Cheatsheet**
  
  Tidyverse Functions & Conventions
  
    - The pipe operator `%>%`
    - Use `dplyr::filter()` to subset data row-wise.
    - Use `dplyr::arrange()`  to sort the observations in a data frame
    - Use `dplyr::mutate()` to update or create new columns of a data frame
    - Use `dplyr::summarize()` to turn many observations into a single data point
    - Use `dplyr::arrange()` to change the ordering of the rows of a data frame 
    - Use `dplyr::select()` to choose variables from a tibble, 
      - keeps only variables you mention
    - Use `dplyr::rename()` keeps all the variables and renames variables
      - rename(iris, petal_length = Petal.Length)
    - These can be combined using `dplyr::group_by()` 
      - which lets you perform operations “by group”. 
    - The `%in%` matches conditions provided by a vector using the c() function
    - The **forcats** package has tidyverse functions 
      - for factors (categorical variables)
    - The **readr** package has tidyverse functions 
      - to read_..., melt_... col_..., parse_... data and objects

Reading Your Code: Whenever you see

  - The assignment operator `<-`, think **"gets"**
  - The pipe operator, `%>%`, think **"then"**
