#### Punchlist: What we need setup for class work (repeat list)

- Setup our Markov and Open Data Science (ODS) Computers

  1. For **Markov Data Science Cluster**
    - login to `http://ondemand.case.edu` with your CaseID account
    - Launch the SDLE Rstudio Server (rxf131)
    - Check your "Library Paths" 
      - in the R console
      - run `.libPaths()`
      - And the first directory MUST be
      - "/home/rxf131/ondemand/ubuntu2004/r4" "/usr/local/lib/R/site-library"
    - otherwise refer to the file in the root directory of your repo
      - named `FixRstudioServer-R-libPaths.txt`
      - and run the "source('/home/rxf131/ondemand/share/config/r-lib-path-fix.R')`
      - In the R console
      - then check your `.libPaths()` again
    - On Markov, launch `LXDE Desktop (rxf131)`
      - make a Git folder under `/home/CaseID/`  
      - Login to DSCI Slack in your firefox browser on LXDE desktop
  2. For the **Open Data Science (ODS) Desktop**
    - login to `http://myapps.case.edu` with your CaseID account
    - Drag icons of to your desktop
      - for R, Rstudio, Git Bash, VScodium, PyCharm, Jupyter Notebook, Slack  
  3. Setup Git
    - make /home/caseID/Git folder on Markov 
      - git config your name and email of your git server
    - make H:\\Git folder on ODS Desktop
      - git config your name and email of your git server
  4. Git Fork the Class "Prof" Repo
    - In your Bitbucket Account
  5. Git Clone your Fork of the Class Repo
  6. When in Rstudio (on Markov or ODS)
    - Its ESSENTIAL that you open the .Rproj file in the upper right corner
    - this tells Rstudio where your root directory of your project is. 
  7. Setup Bitbucket account 
  8. Setup [DSCI Slack Account](http://cwru-dsci.slack.com)
  9. Setup StackExchange account

#### Bash: The language of the Linux Console
 
  - Bash is the command line processor of the Linux Console
  - R has its own command line processor for the R Console
  - Bash is the default Console for both Linux and for Mac
    - Mac's are based on BSD-Unix OS 
    - A close variant of Linux, only differentiated by the licensing
  - Windows uses the DOS command line processor in its 'Command Prompt'

 
##### On our Rstudio Server 4.2.1 on Markov we use Git in the terminal

  - Terminal, like Konsole in KDE, 
    - Uses the standard Bash commands
    - And tools like vim (the visual text editor)
  - You can do this in the Rstudio terminal (not the R console)
    - Or you can start a "Markov Desktop KDE" In ondemand.case.edu 
    
##### On our Win10 ODS Desktop's we use Git Bash to work with Git

  - MinGW64 is a little Linux OS running inside Windows
    - It has the standard Bash commands
    - And tools like vim (the visual text editor)
    
##### Lets see some Bash Commands we'll be using

  - `ls` is the "list" command, 
    - to get a directory of files and folders
  - `pwd` is the "present working directory" command, 
    - to know where you are
  - `cd` is "change directory" 
  - `..` refers to the directory one up from where you are
    - so `cd ..` moves you up one directory
  - and `cd Downloads` would move you down 
    - into Downloads directory (if it exists)
  - To copy a file use `cp`
  - To move a file use `mv`  
  - To make a new directory use `mkdir`
    
##### A good resource for Bash Commands and Man pages

  - Is [An A-Z Index of the Bash command line for Linux](http://ss64.com/bash/)
  - There are many other resources too

#### Now lets start working with our local Git Server

  - Using Git Bash to talk to it
    - Git is also a linux program 
  - All Git commands are entered at the Bash Prompt
  - All Git commands start with `git`
    - So that the Bash prompt know who to send the subsequent command to
    
##### Check your Git Server Configuration
    
  - `git config --list`

##### Essential `git config --global`'s, Set your user info

  - `git config --global user.name "[name]"`
  - `git config --global user.email "[email address]"`
  - `git config --global color.ui auto`

##### First we need to go up to Bitbucket and "Fork" the Prof. Repo

  - Bitbucket will require you make an **Bitbucket App Password**
    - This is different from your password to login to Bitbucket website
    - And they show it to you only once
    - So record it
  - Best is to store it in [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/)
    - An open-source Password Manager
  - Now you need to **Fork the Prof Course Repo"
    - And change "-prof" to "-yourCaseID"
  - This will give you a copy of Prof. Repo
    - In your personal account area on BitBucket website

We have the "Fa22-dsci51" group in the CWRU-DSCI bitbucket team

  - So this group has access to our class prof repo
  - [21f-dsci351-351m-451-e1451-e2451-prof](https://bitbucket.org/cwrudsci/21f-dsci351-351m-451-e1451-e2451-prof/src/main/)
  - To Fork this repo, go to the repo's page on bitbucket
    - On the repo page
    - Look at the plus on the left side bar
    - And choose "Fork this Repo"
  - On the next Forking page
    - You want to remove "prof" from the repo name, 
    - and put you caseID, as the end of your repo name
  - Once you have forked the prof repo
    - You will want to clone it to your computer
    - Using http protocol, if you are on Windows
    - Or using ssh protocol, on Linux or Mac
    
##### Now you want to open Git Bash on Windows

  - You need to save your Repos on your H: drive, NOT C drive
    - C Drive is restricted
    - H Drive is your personal area that follows your caseID login
  - So in Git Bash
    - `pwd` will tell you your present working directory
    - `cd ..` moves up a directory
    - `pwd` to see where you have moved
    - Now change to H: `cd /h`
    - `pwd` see where you are
    - `ls` see what files are there
    - `mkdir Git`  this will make a new directory at H:Git
      - So you'll keep all your repositories under H:Git

##### Important Note: **Windows ignores case, Linux and BSD-Unix (Mac) respect case**

  - So Git and git are the same on windows for a folder
  - They are totally different on Linux or Mac
  - Best practice Use capitals sparingly
  - About only useful place is in CamelBack filenames
    - Since I said, no spaces in filenames
    - To make things readable, you can do CamelBack
    - Example: 1906ITFun-ADSwR-ThisIsMyReport-Name.rmd
    
#### Now lets Clone your personal class repo    
    
  - Now you want to Clone your personal class repo
    - This is a one time operation
    - To copy all the files and folders down to your local computer
  - In Git Bash, you want to be at H:Git or h:Git
    Check with `pwd`
  - Now go to your personal class repo on Bitbucket
    - And find the clone command
    - **For windows choose https protocol (Not ssh)**
  - Copy the command
    - Its something like this 
    - `git clone https://vuvlab@bitbucket.org/cwrudsci/21f-dsci351-351m-451-e1451-e2451-prof.git`
  - Now that that is on your clipboard 
  - Go to you Git Bash, and use "Shift-Insert" (Not "Cntrl-v") 
    - To copy it onto the Bash Command line 
    - Hit enter, and watch a full copy of your repo being copied locally 
    
##### For class repos

  - Before each class, or whenever you want
  - Up on Bitbucket
    - You should sync your fork
    - With my Prof repo
    - To get the latest file version and new files
    - After syncing
    - Now `git pull` to bring the updated files to your local git server

##### Now lets pull and push changes from to your repo

  - cd into your repo's top folder 
    - This can be done with tab completion 
    - `cd 19su-t ` and hit tab, it auto completes 
  - Now type `git pull` To see if there are any changes up on bitbucket 
    And to pull these down and merge them in 

##### Making local changes, Adding, Commmitting and Pushing

  - Now change a local file by adding something into it 
  - Now you add this changed file to be tracked by Git 
    - `git add --all :/` 
  - Now commit your changes
    - `git commit -m 'I have changed the readme.md' `
  - Now push your changes up to Bitbucket, to your personal repo
    - `git push`

#### Some notes on using the ODS Tool Chain

- So if someone installs R programming language, and Rstudio IDE, 

  - then they can run R commands and R scripts.

But in the computers we configure and use in the DSCI classes

  - the SDLE Rstudio Server-4.2.1 on Markov datascience cluster 
    - you access using ondemand.case.edu,
  - or the ODS Desktop 
    - on the Win10 Citrix server 
    - that you access using myapps.case.edu,
  - or if you follow section 11 in the course syllabus 
    - and configure you own notebook that runs linux, mac or windows

We don't just have R & Rstudio.

  - We install the following things that don't come with just R/Rstudio. 
  - git for code versioning and collaboration
  - A LaTeX distribution 
    - (either TexLive on Linux, MikTeX on windows, or MacTeX on Mac)
  - A gui LaTeX Editor called TexStudio
  - R version 4.2.1 (have to also add Rtool4 to add compilers to windows)
  - Rstudio latest version "2022.07.1 Build 554"
  - A set of about 500 R packages, 
    - which give us all the data analysis tools we will use in the class.

So if just having installed R and Rstudio, 

  - you won't have setup for the work in this course. 
    - You won't have git, 
    - you won't have LaTeX 
      - so you can't compile your "R markdown" (filename.Rmd) scripts 
      - to produce a pdf report, 
    - and you won't have all the modeling and graphic packages 
      - we use routinely in our coding.
  - We refer to this as the Open Data Science Tool Chain, 
    - and both SDLE Rstudio Server (rxf131) on Markov, 
    and the ODS Desktop on myapps are already setup.
  - Since it takes time for us to get everyone up and running 
    - with accounts, 
    - and configurations, 
    - forks and clones, 
  - We suggest leaving your "setting up my personal notebook computer 
    - for use as an Open Data Science computer, 
    - for a month or two.
  
#### Markov & the SDLE Rstudio Server (rxf131), vs. the ODS Desktop

  - So on the ODS Desktop (i.e. Win10) 
    - your personal files are kept on H:, 
    - so making `H:\Git\` folder
    - and then use the  command `cd /h/Git`  
    - will make your "present working directory" (`pwd`) be that Git folder.
  - On Markov, You can launch a "Markov Desktop (LXDE)" session.  
    - And then you have a graphical file manager, and terminal.
  - On Markov, you can also do the steps in the terminal (not the R console) 
    - of the "SDLE Rstudio Server (rxf131)" 
    - that you will see in the bottom left quadrant of Rstudio.  
  - In this case this is a linux terminal, 
    - but you don't have a graphical desktop environment for the computer.
  - And the on Markov, 
    - you want to make a Git folder under your "home" directory. 
    - Your "home" directory on Markov is `/home/caseID/`
  - So you want to put your Git repos on Markov 
    - in the folder "/home/caseID/Git"
  - And the first time you want to copy your personal fork of the "Prof" repo, 
    - you need to clone it.
  - So when you Clone your personal class repo. 
    - You want to use the https (normal web) protocol.  
    - The ssh protocol is more complex to setup, 
      - so the default ssh protocol when you first clone won't work, 
      - because you dont have any configured ssh keys.
  - So Clone the repo, 
    - by being in the directory Git folder, on H in the ODS Desktop, 
    - or being in the directory /home/caseID/Git folder on Markov.

So the order of doing things

  - Fork the prof repo 
    - and remove the "prof" and 
    - replace with your caseID in the repo name.
  - Clone the repo, 
    - selecting the http protocol in the upper right of the Clone dialog box, 
    - to get and copy the Clone command.
  - And now using that command, 
    - go  into a Git folder in a sensible location 
      - of your Markov cloud computer, 
      - or ODS Desktop cloud computer, 
    - or to have a copy of the repo on your personal notebook, 
      - into a Git folder on your notebook computer.
  - Run the git clone command, which will look like this: 
    - `git clone https://vuvlab@bitbucket.org/cwrudsci/22f-dsci354-454-CASEID.git`
  - After you have cloned your personal repo, 
    - (probably to these 3 different computers), 
    - you have a full copy of the repo on each.
  - After the first time you clone it. 
    - Everything after that will be `git pull ...` , `git push ...`   
      - to pull down new files or push up new files to and from bitbucket. 

#### Agile Software Development

##### The Agile Manifesto in 2001 

  - [http://agilemanifesto.org/](http://agilemanifesto.org/)
    - [Twelve Principles of Agile Software](http://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html)
  - Has changed how software is developed
    - From large, monolithic programs, with complex "specifications"
    - To small, package-based, codes that integrate for applications
  - e.g. How google updates apps in an ongoing basis
    - Numerous small updates and changes
    - Instead of large multi-year releases
  - Linux is a package-based operating system
    - Windows used to be monolithic
    - And is trying to become more agile 
    
  - Agile Development, has now been generalized for more than software
    - Many companies use Agile Processes in their businesses

##### The Rise and Evolution of Agile Software Development 

  - Article by Hoda, Salleh, Grundy in your repo 3-readings/2-articles
    - Agile software development has dominated the second half of the past 50 years of software engineering. 
    - Retrospectives, one of the most common agile practices, enables reflection on past performance, discussion of current progress, and charting forth directions for future improvement. 
    - Because of agile's burgeoning popularity as the software development model of choice and a significant research subdomain of software engineering, it demands a retrospective of its own. 
    - This article provides a historical overview of agile's main focus areas and a holistic synthesis of its trends, their evolution over the past two decades, agile's current status, and, forecast from these, agile's likely future. 
    - This article is part of a theme issue on software engineering's 50th anniversary.

##### Git code versioning

  - Enables large teams to work on software development
  - [For example the Linux Kernel](https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=Linux-Git-Stats-EOY2019)

##### Slack, a component of Agile Sofware Development

  - An intrinsic part of agile software development
    - There is Slack app for phones
    - And client for computers, its on vdi.
  - an online collaboration tool


###### CWRU Data Science Slack

  - We have a CWRU Data Science Slack
  - You can join by signing up at [https://cwru-dsci.slack.com](https://cwru-dsci.slack.com)
    - Sign up using your case.edu email address
  - There is a specific class channel, 
    - along with general, 
    - applied data science 
    - and job opportunities channels.
    
The class Slack channel 

  - is a good place for discussing questions 
  - from class and/or assignments.

Class communications will be via Slack

#### Donald Knuth, A computer scientist and Case Alumnus

[Donald Knuth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Knuth)

  - Alma mater	
    - Case Institute of Technology (B.S., M.S.) 1960
    - California Institute of Technology (Ph.D.)
  - ["Why I choose to go to Case Institute of Technology](https://www.webofstories.com/people/donald.knuth/10?o=SH)


##### The Art of Computer Programming, by Donald Knuth

- Major things he's done in Computing

[The Art of Computer Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Art_of_Computer_Programming) 

  - (sometimes known by its initials TAOCP)
  - covers many kinds of programming algorithms and their analysis.
  
###### [Literate Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming), was another of his goals

- Literate programming is a programming paradigm introduced by Donald Knuth 

  - in which a program is given as an explanation of the program logic in a natural language, such as English, 
  - interspersed with snippets of macros and traditional source code, from which a compilable source code can be generated.

The literate programming paradigm, as conceived by Knuth, 

  - represents a move away from writing programs 
    - in the manner and order imposed by the computer, 
    - and instead enables programmers to develop programs in the order 
    - demanded by the logic and flow of their thoughts. 
  - Literate programs are written as an uninterrupted exposition of logic 
    - in an ordinary human language, much like the text of an essay, 
    - in which macros are included to hide abstractions and traditional source code.
  - Literate programming (LP) tools are used to obtain two representations from a literate source file: 
    - one suitable for further compilation or execution by a computer, the "tangled" code, 
    - and another for viewing as formatted documentation, which is said to be "woven" from the literate source. 
  - While the first generation of literate programming tools 
    - were computer language-specific, 
    - the later ones are language-agnostic 
    - and exist above the programming languages.

[Now adays one can integrate R and Python code in a common shared environmet, as can be done with Rstudio v1.2 and the reticulate package.
We use this in our data analytics in the SDLE Research Center at CWRU.] 

##### LaTeX, by Donald Knuth

- [LaTeX publishing system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TeX)

  - A typesetting system designed & written by Donald Knuth, released in 1978. 
  - TeX was designed with two main goals in mind: 
    - to allow anybody to produce high-quality books using minimal effort, and 
    - to provide a system that would give exactly the same results on all computers, 
    - at any point in time.[2] 
  - TeX is free software, which made it accessible to a wide range of users


#### Your Open Data Science Tool Chain

##### Its all about a Data Science Tool Chain

  - Use R and build on the communities foundation
  - Use Rstudio as a comfy environment
  - Share your Open Data and Open Source Code
  - Produce Reproducible Science with Rmarkdown  
    - Use [Creative Commons Licenses](https://creativecommons.org/)
    - Or other [Open Source Licenses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_free_and_open-source_software_licenses)
    - Such as the [Gnu Public License: GPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License)
