##### Tidyverse Cheatsheets, Functions and Reading Your Code

Look at the Tidyverse Cheatsheet 

  - **Tidyverse For Beginners Cheatsheet**
    - In the Git/20s-dsci353-353m-453-prof/3-readings/3-CheatSheets/ folder
  - **Data Wrangling with dplyr and tidyr Cheatsheet**

  
  Tidyverse Functions & Conventions
  
    - The pipe operator `%>%`
    - Use `dplyr::filter()` to subset data row-wise.
    - Use `dplyr::arrange()`  to sort the observations in a data frame
    - Use `dplyr::mutate()` to update or create new columns of a data frame
    - Use `dplyr::summarize()` to turn many observations into a single data point
    - Use `dplyr::arrange()` to change the ordering of the rows of a data frame 
    - Use `dplyr::select()` to choose variables from a tibble, 
      - keeps only variables you mention
    - Use `dplyr::rename()` keeps all the variables and renames variables
      - rename(iris, petal_length = Petal.Length)
    - These can be combined using `dplyr::group_by()` 
      - which lets you perform operations “by group”. 
    - The `%in%` matches conditions provided by a vector using the c() function
    - The **forcats** package has tidyverse functions 
      - for factors (categorical variables)
    - The **readr** package has tidyverse functions 
      - to read_..., melt_... col_..., parse_... data and objects

Reading Your Code: Whenever you see

  - The assignment operator `<-`, think **"gets"**
  - The pipe operator, `%>%`, think **"then"**

#### Syllabus

![DSCI351-351M-451 Syllabus](./figs/syllabus.png)


#### Final Exam ( worth 20 pts)

  - Will be held Monday 12/13 
      - From 12pm to 3pm
  - Comprehensive overview of the course 
  
##### Before the final exam

- Confirm that you can 

  - `git push` and `git pull` your class repo

So using the five commands on your fork of the git "...Prof" repository

  - `git pull`
  - `git status`
  - `git add --all :/`
  - `git status`
  - `git commit -m 'my commit message'`
  - `git status`
  - `git push`

##### Also confirm that you are running in Markov 

  - And confirm that you have this when you first launch your Rstudio-4.2.2 app
    - in your R console of Rstudio
  - And the R version is now 4.2.2

  --------------------

 initializing... 

 R lib path check:  /home/rxf131/ondemand/ubuntu2004/r4

 Time zone check:  America/New_York

  --------------------

If you don't have "R lib path check: "

  - With "/home/rxf131/ondemand/ubuntu2004/r4"
    - As the FIRST directory in the list
  - Then you need to run the `source .....` command
    - That is in the "FixRstudioServer-R-libPaths.txt"
    - in the root directory of your class repo
  - The command to run is 
    - `source('/home/rxf131/ondemand/share/config/r-lib-path-fix.R')`

##### Final Exam Format

  - The exam will appear in the prof repo
  - In /assignments/finalexam folder
  - Done as Rmd file to turn in as .pdf report
  - Submit Final Exam .Rmd, .pdf to the Canvas Assignment Page

#### Questions on Course

##### Overarching Goal of Course

  - Teach you how to do real data analysis projects
    - Using a modern data analysis tool chain
    - Using real-world and lab-based (messy) datasets
  - Learn EDA to explore and discover insights from your data
    - And identify new data and metadata needed for data assembly

To achieve these goals 

  - What could be done better 

##### Utility of the 3 text books (R4DS, OIS, ISLR)

  - Which did you find useful? 
  - Which were not useful? 

##### The 3 books we used 

  - (R4DS) R for Data Science 
  - (OIS) Open Intro Stats v3 
  - (ISLR) Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R 
  

##### Git Class Repo structure to class 

  - This is a basic open-source collaboration method 
    - did not use repo for turning in assignments 
    - better by Git or by Blackboard/Canvas?
