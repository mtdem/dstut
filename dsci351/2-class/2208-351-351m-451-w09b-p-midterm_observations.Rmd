### Syllabus

![DSCI351-351M-451 Syllabus](./figs/syllabus.png)


### For the DSCI 451 students they have an EDA SemProj to do

- Some students didn't submit their Report out *.mp4 zoom file

  - So we'll circulate these as just pdfs for peer grading
    - an extra point for feedback on these



## Results and Observations from Midterm

  - Make sure you are loading the packages you are using!
    - Sometimes packages can run in your console
    - But don't run when you knit your PDF
    - And eventually, you don't see outputs.
  - The `library(tidyverse)` command
    - Is part of your code
    - It has to be in your .Rmd or .R file
      
  - CHECK YOUR SUBMISSIONS
    - We are not responsible for chasing down
      - Incorrect submissions
      - Late work
      - Un-uploaded PDFs
          
  - Explain your answers in detail
    - 'Yes' or 'No' will not receive full points
    - Comment your code
      - We can give more CREDIT IF you properly explain your thought process
      - As opposed to just showing the code
          
  - ?? and ? can be used to access the help documentation
    - This information can be useful in determining 
    - What function is from each package

### The Curve: DSCI is graded on a curve

- Results
  
DSCI 351/451

  - A > 93
  - B > 84
  - C > 75
  - D > 65

### MidTerm Grades

- The midterm grades
  
  - Use all the graded submissions of each student
    - If an assignment or activity
      - has not been graded
      - has not been submitted
    - It wasn't counted
      - So these grades didn't have "assumed zero points"
      
![Midterm Grades](./figs/DSCI351-351m-451-midterm-grades.png)

### General Observations and Common Mistakes
          
- ALL SUBMISSIONS should be DOUBLE CHECKED for proper submission quality
  
  - We cannot give points if we don't see reasonable outputs
  - This is applicable for LEs and exams
  - It is the responsibility of the student 
    - to verify that they are submitting the correct file
          
  - Explain your answers in detail
    - 'Yes' or 'No' will not receive full points
    - Comment your code
      - We can give more CREDIT IF you properly explain your thought process
      - As opposed to just showing the code
          
  - Some questions can be answered by knowing how certain functions work
    - `?function-name` and `??function-name` can be used 
      - to access the help documentation
    - This information can be useful 
      - in determining which function is from a certain package
      
  - Some students have spent a lot of time on some questions
    - And couldn't work on the remaining ones
    - Don't spend too much time on one question
    - Time management is always important!


### Comments on Grading Philosophy for the Midterm

  - Deductions where made for 
    - improper solutions 
    - and missing information. 
  
  - Failure to library in the appropriate packages 
    - resulted in a point deduction, 
    - with a maximum deduction of 0.5.
  - Additional points were deducted 
    - for not obtaining the output.
      
  - Solutions that 
    - did not library the appropriate packages 
    - and were incorrect received no credit. 
  
  - Partial credit was assigned as needed, 
    - especially when a solution was properly documented with comments.
