  * Final Exam
    *  Final: Monday December 19, 2022, 12:00PM - 3:00PM, Nord 356 or remote

#### Final Exam ( worth 20 pts)

  - Will be held Monday 12/19
      - From 12pm to 3pm
  - Comprehensive overview of the course 
  
##### Before the final exam

- Confirm that you can 

  - `git push` and `git pull` your class repo
  
Confirm that you have your personal course Repo

  - Cloned on Ondemand.case.edu, Markov Data Science Cluster
    - in /mnt/pan/courses/dsci351-451/caseID/Git/...
  - And on myapps.case.edu, Open Data Science (ODS) Desktop
    - in /h/Git/....

So using the five commands on your fork of the git "...Prof" repository

  - `git pull`
  - `git status`
  - `git add --all :/`
  - `git status`
  - `git commit -m 'my commit message'`
  - `git status`
  - `git push`

##### Also confirm that you are running in Markov, and tested ODS Desktop 

  - And confirm that you have this when you first launch your Rstudio-4.2.2 app
    - in your R console of Rstudio
    - And the R version is now 4.2.2
  - On Markov, Check `.libPaths()` and that the first entry is
    - `[1] "/home/rxf131/ondemand/ubuntu2004/r4"`

  --------------------

 initializing... 

 R lib path check:  /home/rxf131/Kub1804/R-4.1.1 /usr/local/lib/R/site-library /usr/lib/R/site-library /usr/lib/R/library 

 Python path check:  /usr/local/lib/python3.6/dist-packages:/home/rxf131/Kub1804/Py3-packages 

 Time zone check:  America/New_York 

  --------------------

If you don't have "R lib path check: "

  - With "/home/rxf131/Kub1804/R-4.1.1"
    - As the FIRST directory in the list
  - Then you need to run the `source .....` command
    - That is in the "FixRstudioServer-R-libPaths.txt"
    - in the root directory of your class repo
  - The command to run is 
    - `source('/home/rxf131/ondemand/share/config/r-lib-path-fix.R')`

##### Final Exam Format

  - The exam will appear in the prof repo
  - In /assignments/finalexam folder
  - Done as Rmd file to turn in as .pdf report
  - Submit Final Exam .Rmd, .pdf to the Canvas Assignment Page
  - If you have problems compiling to .pdf
    - Then instead compile to .html
    - Open that html file in your browser
    - Print it to file, as a .pdf
    - And upload that .pdf, with the .Rmd to the Canvass Assignment page

#### Questions on Course

##### Overarching Goal of Course

  - Teach you how to do real data analysis projects
    - Using a modern data analysis tool chain
    - Using real-world and lab-based (messy) datasets
  - Learn EDA to explore and discover insights from your data
    - And identify new data and metadata needed for data assembly

To achieve these goals 

  - What could be done better 

##### Utility of the 3 text books (R4DS, OIS, ISLR)

  - Which did you find useful? 
  - Which were not useful? 

##### The 3 books we used 

  - (R4DS) R for Data Science 
  - (OIS) Open Intro Stats v3 
  - (ISLR) Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R 
  

##### Git Class Repo structure to class 

  - This is a basic open-source collaboration method 
    - did not use repo for turning in assignments 
    - better by Git or by Blackboard/Canvas?
