##### Syllabus

![DSCI351-351M-451 Syllabus](./figs/syllabus.png)

##### Prof. Laura Bruckman will present in class today, Thursday, on SemProjs

- To give more information on the Semester Projects for DSCI453 students

  -  This includes 3 Reports Outs by 453 Students
    - That **all students will view and do peer grading of**

#### The Lab Exercises (LEs)

- Each LE is worth
  - LE1,2 are 7 points
  - LE3-7 are 10 points 
    - (except LE0 = 0 points)

So 64 points are in the Lab Exercises

  - So these are important and critical to learning
  - You will need to start on the early
    - This is why you are given two weeks to do them
  - You turn in both the .Rmd and the .pdf file
    - We grade on the .pdf file in Canvas
  - We expect good code styling
    - That matches the Google/Rstudio R Style Guide
    - Since this aides collaboration

#### Where we are at present in Class

- So as of today, 

We need to make all elements for the ODS tools chain working for you

  - You have logged into your CaseID email at http://webmail.case.edu
    - And have setup Duo for Two Factor Authentication (2FA)
  - You have joined the DSCI Slack
    - At https://cwru-dsci.slack.com
    - Using your CaseID@case.edu email 
  - You setup a bitbucket.org account
    - using your CaseID email account
    - And have setup your Bitbucket "App Password"
  - You have "forked" the 22f-dsci351-451-prof "prof" repo
    - And have change "prof" to your caseID
    - And made your fork in the CWRU-DSCI team
  - You have configured your git server
    - on both Markov, in your /home/CaseID/Git folder
      - and on ODS Desktop, in your H:/Git folder
      - and on your personal notebook computer, in a Git folder you make
    - And these configurations define your name and email
      - `git config --global user.name "[name]"`
      - `git config --global user.email "[email address]"`
  - Then you want to clone your personal course repo to 3 places
    - Markov/OnDemand: git clone... to /home/CaseID/Git/  
    - ODS Desktop/MyApps: git clone... to H:/Git/   
    - On your own computer to Git folder (to enable easy reading pdf)
    
If not, reach out to the TAs ( Will Oltjen, Krisen Hernandez, Mingxuan Li )

  - Using the http://cwru-dsci.slack.com
    - Which you can join directly using your CaseID@case.edu email address
  - Defining where you issue is
  - And we'll fix it
  
#### Markov HPC and Open Data Science (ODS) Compute Engines

- You can do data analysis on your notebook computer

  - You can setup your own notebook
    - For data science using R or Python
    - Full instructions are in the class syllabus 
      - Section 11
    - For Linux, Mac's or Windows Operating Systems
    - But Many times you'll need more compute power than your notebook
      - Such as GPUs (Graphics Processing Units) to accelerate computations
    
But its useful to learn about a variety of Compute Resources

  - In Class we'll use 
    - Markov Data Science Cluster
      - A high performance computing cluster
      - via http://ondemand.case.edu
    - or Open Data Science Desktops
      - A Win10 cloud desktop
      - via http://myapps.case.edu
These are all configured the same

  - Independent of the Operating System
  - They have R with Rstudio IDE (Integrated Development Environment)
  - Git for code versioning
  - LaTeX for publication quality report generation
  - And also Python3 with VS Codium or PyCharm IDE
  
The two cloud computing systems: Markov HPC Cluster & ODS Win10 Desktop

  - Markov Data Science HPC Compute Cluster, via OnDemand
    - Log in to http://ondemand.case.edu 
    - Using your CaseID and password
    - Launch the Rstudio Server (rxf131)
      - Which runs R version 4.2.1
    - You can also get an LXDE graphical desktop on Markov

CWRU HPC provides Markov

  - [CWRU's HPC (High Peformance Computing) Markov Cluster](https://sites.google.com/a/case.edu/hpcc/)
    - This runs RedHat Linux version 7
    - Has 4400 CPU cores
    - Has 100,000 GPU cores
    - Up to a terabyte of Ram
  - And has a new Data Science Cluster, named [Markov.case.edu](https://markov.case.edu)
    - With a Hadoop Cluster for distributed computing
    - And dedicated GPUs
  - You'll get accounts on CWRU HPC
  - And use [http://ondemand.case.edu](http://ondemand.case.edu)
    - To login to Markov and get a Rstudio Server (rxf131) session
    - Or a LXDE graphical desktop session 
      - for simple file operations or a browser
  
![Markov Cluster](./figs/markov.png)
  
- You also have access to the ODS Win10 Desktops

  - These are cloud Windows computers
    - That you log into from a Browser 
    - login to http://myapps.case.edu
    - With your CaseID and password
  - The ODS VDIs are Windows 10 computers
  - The ODS VDIs don't have GPUs
    
Not for class, but for your own data science projects.

And you can use Google's Collaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/welcome.ipynb)

  - For Jupyter Notebooks
  - Running Python3
  - Doesn't support R language yet
  - Free GPUs and [TPUs (Tensor Processing Unit)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor_processing_unit)


#### What we need to do now

- Setup our Markov and Open Data Science (ODS) Computers

  1. For Markov Data Science Cluster
    - login to `http://ondemand.case.edu` with your CaseID account
    - Launch the SDLE Rstudio Server (rxf131)
    - Check your "Library Paths" 
      - in the R console
      - run `.libPaths()`
      - And the first directory MUST be
      - "/home/rxf131/ondemand/ubuntu2004/r4" "/usr/local/lib/R/site-library"
    - otherwise refer to the file in the root directory of your repo
      - named `FixRstudioServer-R-libPaths.txt`
      - and run the "source('/home/rxf131/ondemand/share/config/r-lib-path-fix.R')`
      - In the R console
      - then check your `.libPaths()` again
    - On Markov, launch `LXDE Desktop (rxf131)`
      - make a Git folder under `/home/CaseID/`  
      - Login to DSCI Slack in your firefox browser on LXDE desktop
  2. For the ODS Desktop
    - login to `http://myapps.case.edu` with your CaseID account
    - Drag icons of to your desktop
      - for R, Rstudio, Git Bash, VScodium, PyCharm, Jupyter Notebook, Slack  
  3. Setup Git
    - make /home/caseID/Git folder on Markov 
      - git config your name and email of your git server
    - make H:\\Git folder on ODS Desktop
      - git config your name and email of your git server
  4. Git Fork the Class "Prof" Repo
    - In your Bitbucket Account
  5. Git Clone your Fork of the Class Repo
  6. When in Rstudio (on Markov or ODS)
    - Its ESSENTIAL that you open the .Rproj file in the upper right corner
    - this tells Rstudio where your root directory of your project is. 
  7. Setup Bitbucket account 
  8. Setup [DSCI Slack Account](http://cwru-dsci.slack.com)
  9. Setup StackExchange account
    
##### So go make accounts, using your case.edu email address

  - Most students have already been invited
    - Pitt, UCF, UTRGV students have been issued CaseIDs
    - That you will use for logging in to

  - Share your Open Data and Open Source Code
  - Produce Reproducible Science with Rmarkdown  
    + Use [Creative Commons Licenses](https://creativecommons.org/)
    + Or other [Open Source Licenses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_free_and_open-source_software_licenses)
    + Such as the [Gnu Public License: GPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License)
    - Or one of my favorites, [the Apache License](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_License)

###### Pilot your Data Science studies using available data
